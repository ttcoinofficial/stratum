Description:
============
This is implementation of Stratum protocol for server and client side
using asynchronous networking written in Python Twisted.

Installation
============

Requirements:
python 2.6 or 2.7
linux-based system (should work on Mac OS too, not tested)

Following instructions will work on Ubuntu & Debian*:

a) From GIT, for developers
git clone git://github.com/slush0/stratum.git 
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo python setup.py develop

b) From package, permanent install for production use
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install stratum

*) Debian don't have a 'sudo' command, please do the installation
process as a root user.

Remove the distribute_setup.py and edit setup.py to remove these lines.

From
-from distribute_setup import use_setuptools
-use_setuptools()
-py_modules=['distribute_setup',],

Then run this to make sure that distribute is up-to-date.
pip install --upgrade distribute

Then try installing again with.
sudo python setup.py install

The process is full of errors and a lot of them are not very obvious. Top tip, enable the stratum.log while setting up stratum-mining, it will help.

git clone https://github.com/ttcoinofficial/litecoin_scrypt.git
git clone https://github.com/ttcoinofficial/stratum-mining.git
git clone https://github.com/ttcoinofficial/stratum.git

cd ~/stratum-mining
git submodule init
git submodule update

cd ~/litecoin_scrypt
sudo python setup.py install

cd ~/stratum
sudo python setup.py install


Configuration
=============

a) Basic configuration
Copy config_default.py to config.py
Edit at least those values: HOSTNAME, BITCOIN_TRUSTED_*

b) Message signatures
For enabling message signatures, generate server's ECDSA key by
python signature.py > signing_key.pem
and fill correct values to SIGNING_KEY and SIGNING_ID (config.py)

c) Creating keys for SSL-based transports
For all SSL-based transports (HTTPS, WSS, ...) you'll need private key
and certificate file. You can use certificates from any authority or you can
generate self-signed certificates, which is helpful at least for testing.

Following script will generate self-signed SSL certificate:

#!/bin/bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
cp server.key server.key.org
openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

Then you have to fill SSL_PRIVKEY and SSL_CACERT in config file with
values 'server.key' and 'server.crt'.

Startup
=======
Start devel server:
twistd -ny launcher.tac

Devel server *without* lowlevel messages of Twisted:
twistd -ny launcher.tac -l log/twistd.log
 
Running in production
=====================
TODO: Guide for running twistd as a daemon, init scripts
TODO: Loadbalancing and port redirecting using haproxy
TODO: Tunelling on 80/443 using stunnel
Any volunteer for this ^ ?
